    "text": "Statistical methods & models\nTo analyze the association between various health and wellness conditions in each state in 2022 or earlier and the eventual implemented level of abortion policy post Dobbs decision, we used four hypothesis testing methods. Our variable of interest (the abortion policy level) is a multinomial categorical variable, but it has many limiting characteristics that violate assumptions for many common baseline methods, such as ANOVA and Chi-square. The sample sizes (the count of observations in each level of abortion policy) were very uneven, and some sample sizes were extremely small (with a total count of 2), which violates the assumptions of some methods. In particular, this violates Chi-square’s assumption that the expected count frequency for each variable combination is at least 5. This also violates ANOVA’s assumptions of homoscedasticity and the normality of residuals, because one abortion policy level was composed of two states, while there were sixteen states with very restrictive abortion policies. Therefore, we made sure to deploy statistical tests that were appropriate for our small and uneven data. These tests and their use cases are described below.\nFor assessing the association between numerical variables and abortion policy level:\n\nPermutation-based ANOVA test\n\nThis is a non-parametric, robust alternative to traditional ANOVA that evaluates differences in means between levels of a categorical variable without requiring the assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances.\nNull hypothesis → the means across all levels of abortion policy are equal.\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one group mean is significantly different from the rest.\n\nKruskal-Wallis\n\nThis is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether there are significant differences between the medians of two or more independent groups by comparing the ranks of data across groups to test for differences rather than relying on raw data values. This test also permits data that does not meet the assumptions for ANOVA.\nNull hypothesis → The medians across all levels of abortion policy are equal.\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one group median is significantly different from the rest.\n\n\nFor assessing the association between binary variables and abortion policy level:\n\nFisher’s Exact Test\n\nThis is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a contingency table. It is an appropriate alternative to the Chi-square test when sample size assumption, which states that the expected frequencies in all contingency table cells must be greater than 5, is violated. Our data naturally violates this assumption, making Fisher’s Exact Test a suitable method for assessing differences among our small abortion policy levels.\nNull hypothesis → There is no association between the binary variable and the abortion policy.\nAlternative hypothesis → There is an association between the binary variable and the abortion policy\n\nExact Logistic Regression\n\nThis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary outcome (dependent variable) and an independent variable, particularly when traditional logistic regression assumptions are violated. When sample sizes are very small, traditional logistic regression may produce unreliable results due to large standard errors. This test calculates exact p-values for parameter estimates rather than relying on asymptotic approximations.\nNull hypothesis → The abortion policy has no effect on the probability of the binary outcome\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one level of abortion policy significantly affects the probability of the binary outcome\n\n\nRelevant and insightful data visualizations were also provided alongside these tests to illuminate the characteristics of the data and provide additional information on the differences among abortion policy levels. Please see the Results section for our statistical testing outcomes."

By contrast, as policies become more restrictive, there is an apparent increase in the proportion of states categorized as “unhealthy” or “below average.”\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis Test: captures difference in overall_healths numeric rankings\nkruskal.test(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  overall_health_ranking by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 23.649, df = 6, p-value = 0.0006058\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis Test’s p-value, 0.0006058, provides evidence supporting that the differences in the numeric overall health rankings across the seven levels of abortion policy restrictiveness are statistically significant.  The result supports the observation from the stacked bar plot: more restrictive abortion policies tend to align with poorer health outcomes, while more protective policies are associated with better health outcomes. This suggests that states with restrictive abortion policies are not only limiting access to reproductive healthcare but may also be falling behind in fostering broader public health outcomes. These restrictive states disproportionately represent environments where overall health conditions are poorer, potentially reflecting a lack of investment in comprehensive healthcare systems or preventative care infrastructure. Alternatively, states with protective abortion policies appear to align with stronger public health systems, where access to care and preventative measures may contribute to better overall health rankings. This pattern underscores a broader connection between policy decisions prioritizing individual health rights and the overall well-being of a population.\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The mean overall health rankings are equal across all levels of abortion policy.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one group median of overall health rankings is significantly different from the others across abortion policy levels.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = overall_health_ranking, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Overall Health Ranking\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Overall Health Ranking by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Rankings are ordinal, where 1 represents the best state and 51 represents the worst state (including D.C.) for overall health. Interpretations should consider that rankings provide relative comparisons, not absolute measures of health. This applies to all ranked variables going forward.\nThe bar plot illustrates that states with “most protective” abortion policies have the lowest mean rankings, indicating better overall health outcomes. As abortion policies become more restrictive, the mean rankings increase, suggesting poorer overall health outcomes. States with “most restrictive” abortion policies have the highest mean rankings, reflecting the worst overall health outcomes in this comparison.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 100000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$overall_health_ranking &lt;- sample(permuted_data$overall_health_ranking)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 6.588876 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 4e-05 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yielded an extremely low p-value of 0.00004 indicating that the likelihood of observing an F-statistic as extreme as 6.588876 under the null hypothesis (that the means are equal across all groups) is very small, providing strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is a significant difference in the means of overall health rankings across the levels of abortion policy suggesting that the ranking of states’ overall health outcomes varies meaningfully depending on their abortion policy classifications.\n\n\n\nThe findings highlight a broader relationship between abortion policy and public health infrastructure, states with more protective abortion policies consistently demonstrate better overall health rankings, which suggests a prioritization of comprehensive healthcare systems that extend beyond reproductive care. It’s possible that these states may invest more heavily in preventative care, access to healthcare services, and public health initiatives, fostering environments that support healthier populations. By contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies are associated with poorer overall health rankings, reflecting potential under investment in public health systems and preventative measures. This pattern suggests that restrictive abortion policies may be indicative of broader systemic issues in health equity and resource allocation, therefore, addressing these disparities requires a policy approach that not only ensures reproductive autonomy but also strengthens the broader healthcare infrastructure to promote better health outcomes across all states."

States with “most restrictive” abortion policies have the highest mean rankings, reflecting the worst overall health outcomes in this comparison.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 100000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$overall_health_ranking &lt;- sample(permuted_data$overall_health_ranking)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 6.588876 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 4e-05 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yielded an extremely low p-value of 0.00004 indicating that the likelihood of observing an F-statistic as extreme as 6.588876 under the null hypothesis (that the means are equal across all groups) is very small, providing strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is a significant difference in the means of overall health rankings across the levels of abortion policy suggesting that the ranking of states’ overall health outcomes varies meaningfully depending on their abortion policy classifications.\n\n\n\nThe findings highlight a broader relationship between abortion policy and public health infrastructure, states with more protective abortion policies consistently demonstrate better overall health rankings, which suggests a prioritization of comprehensive healthcare systems that extend beyond reproductive care. It’s possible that these states may invest more heavily in preventative care, access to healthcare services, and public health initiatives, fostering environments that support healthier populations. By contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies are associated with poorer overall health rankings, reflecting potential under investment in public health systems and preventative measures. This pattern suggests that restrictive abortion policies may be indicative of broader systemic issues in health equity and resource allocation, therefore, addressing these disparities requires a policy approach that not only ensures reproductive autonomy but also strengthens the broader healthcare infrastructure to promote better health outcomes across all states."

The exact logistic regression’s likelihood ratio test (p = 0.0924) suggests that the overall model is not statistically significant. However, the Wald test (p = 0.0483) and previous findings from Fisher’s Exact Test indicate that specific associations between abortion policy levels and Medicaid expansion status may be statistically significant.  These differing results highlight the complexity of the relationship and suggest that while the overall model fit may not be strong, there is evidence of specific patterns worth exploring further. The trend observed in the slope coefficients indicates that states with more restrictive abortion policies tend to have lower probabilities of Medicaid expansion, whereas states with protective policies show higher probabilities of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\nImplications\nThis potential pattern may highlight a critical divide in policy decisions: states prioritizing broader reproductive rights are also more likely to expand healthcare access through Medicaid, whereas restrictive abortion policies align with reduced Medicaid expansion, which underscores the broader policy implications of prioritizing access to healthcare and reproductive rights. This alignment reflects deeper policy priorities and ideological differences between states, where those prioritizing reproductive rights often demonstrate a commitment to broader public health initiatives and social safety nets. On the other hand, states with restrictive abortion policies may deprioritize investments in Medicaid and other mechanisms that improve healthcare access for vulnerable populations, further widening disparities in healthcare equity.\nThis divide carries significant implications for health outcomes, particularly for low-income individuals and marginalized communities who depend on Medicaid for essential care. The reduced likelihood of Medicaid expansion in restrictive states may exacerbate health inequities, leading to weakened access to preventative care, maternal healthcare, and chronic disease management."

States with protective abortion policies likely integrate reproductive healthcare into comprehensive healthcare initiatives, fostering better access and affordability. In contrast, restrictive states, which often frame their policies as being “pro-life,” may focus on generalized or inconsistent healthcare frameworks, leading to poorer outcomes. The lack of affordable and accessible healthcare in these states undermines their claims to protect life, as they fail to support the broader well-being of the populations they govern. These findings underscore both the interconnectedness between reproductive healthcare policy and overall healthcare accessibility and affordability, and the disconnect in restrictive states between policy rhetoric and actionable support for healthier communities."

The association complements the visualization and highlights how policy decisions in these states may systematically limit or increase access to reproductive healthcare and broader health support systems, reinforcing disparities in healthcare infrastructure and prioritization.\nTo explore the direction and strength of this relationship, a logistic regression is attempted.\n\n\nCode\n# Tabulate categories to see if sample sizes are sufficient\ntable(df$state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception, df$abortion_policies)\n\n\n   \n    most protective very protective protective some restrictions/protections\n  0               0               1          1                             1\n  1               2               6          9                             4\n   \n    restrictive very restrictive most restrictive\n  0           4                2               11\n  1           3                2                5\n\n\nThe sample sizes are too small for standard logistic regression, particularly for the “most protective” and “very protective” categories which lack representation in one of the outcome groups.

Among the coefficients, states classified as having “most restrictive” abortion policies show the largest negative coefficient (-2.347), indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage compared to the reference group (“most protective”). Similarly, states with “very restrictive” policies also exhibit a negative coefficient (-1.609), further supporting this trend. In contrast, the coefficients for “protective” and “very protective” policy levels are closer to zero, reflecting smaller deviations from the reference group.\nThe predicted probabilities demonstrate a clear gradient: states with more restrictive abortion policies consistently exhibit lower probabilities of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage compared to those with more protective policies. This pattern underscores how more restrictive policies are associated with reduced support for measures that increase contraceptive accessibility, revealing a broader policy divide between states.\n\n\nImplications\nThis pattern highlights a significant disparity in healthcare priorities between states with restrictive and protective abortion policies.By failing to require prescription coverage, particularly for contraceptives, these states not only limit access to essential tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, effectively undermining efforts to reduce the need for abortions in the first place, but also neglect the broader healthcare needs of individuals. Moreover, by not mandating prescription coverage, these states create barriers for women who rely on contraceptives for managing health conditions such as dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, or hormonal imbalances. These barriers can significantly impact quality of life for women who need access to these treatments. In contrast, states with protective abortion policies often require prescription coverage, reflecting a more comprehensive approach to healthcare that supports not only women’s reproductive autonomy but also the broader health needs of their populations."

This provides strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is a significant difference in the rankings of healthcare quality and prevention across the levels of abortion policy, suggesting that the quality of healthcare prevention services varies meaningfully depending on state abortion policy classifications.\nThis finding is further supported by the accompanying visualization, which displays the proportion of states classified as having above or below-average healthcare quality and prevention rankings across different abortion policy levels. States with more protective abortion policies are predominantly above average, while states with restrictive policies show a higher proportion of below-average rankings.

In contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies consistently rank worse, potentially indicating less emphasis on preventative care or healthcare quality. This association underscores how restrictive reproductive healthcare policies may correlate with broader systemic healthcare shortcomings, which can perpetuate or exacerbate health inequities. Furthermore, these disparities may reflect differing state priorities, where restrictive policies often coincide with under investment in public health infrastructure, potentially leading to poorer outcomes not just in reproductive health but across all facets of healthcare access and delivery. Addressing these systemic gaps may require policy reforms that align reproductive rights with a broader commitment to equitable and comprehensive healthcare."

This trend suggests a correlation between the restrictiveness of abortion policies and overall health outcomes, with more restrictive policies aligning with worse health outcomes.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test Implementation for Health Outcomes by Abortion Policy\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(health_outcomes ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) # For reproducibility\nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$health_outcomes &lt;- sample(permuted_data$health_outcomes)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(health_outcomes ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 5.608316 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 2e-04 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA permutation test had an observed F-statistic of 5.608316 and a p-value of 0.0002, which is statistically significant, and supports the conclusion that health outcomes vary significantly across abortion policy levels. The visualization of the permutation distribution shows that the observed F-statistic lies far to the right of the simulated null distribution, providing strong evidence that these differences are unlikely to have arisen by chance. These findings underscore the measurable impact of abortion policy restrictiveness on broader health outcomes, indicating systemic disparities in public health quality across states.\nThis finding is further supported by the accompanying visualization, which displays the proportion of states classified as having above or below-average healthcare outcome rankings across different abortion policy levels.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Calculate the overall average\noverall_avg &lt;- mean(df$health_outcomes, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Filter and classify observations as Above or Below Average\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(abortion_policies) & !is.na(health_outcomes)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(above_or_below = if_else(health_outcomes &gt; overall_avg, \n                                  \"Above Average\", \"Below Average\"))\n\n# Group and count observations\ndf_count &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies, above_or_below) %&gt;%\n  summarize(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Convert counts to percentages\ndf_count &lt;- df_count %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart\nggplot(df_count, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percentage, fill = above_or_below)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Above Average\" = \"#ff0000\", \"Below Average\" = \"#1c7416\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"Percentage of Observations\",\n       fill = \"Comparison to Average\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Above/Below Average Health Outcomes by Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications\nThese trends suggest that states with more restrictive abortion policies may lack broader investments in public health infrastructure and services, contributing to poorer overall health outcomes. In contrast, states with protective abortion policies might prioritize comprehensive healthcare systems that address a wider array of health determinants. This disparity underscores the broader implications of policy decisions on public health and well-being, highlighting potential inequities in access to essential healthcare resources.States with protective policies arguably demonstrate a stronger commitment to addressing root causes of poor health through preventative care and access to essential resources, suggesting that healthcare priorities may reflect broader state-level commitments to equity and well-being."

The “protective” category displays the highest median OB-GYN ratio and the widest distribution, reflecting significant variability in access to OB-GYNs among states in this policy category. Conversely, the most restrictive policy levels are associated with lower median OB-GYN ratios, suggesting that restrictive abortion policies may correlate with reduced access to OB-GYN services. Outliers are visible in some categories, such as “very protective” and “protective,” indicating that some states deviate substantially from the typical access levels for their policy category. Overall, the plot suggests a potential relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and OB-GYN access, with more restrictive policies possibly contributing to reduced availability of reproductive healthcare providers.\nTo test for statistical significance in these observed patterns, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis Test\nkruskal.test(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  obgyn_per_100k by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 10.089, df = 6, p-value = 0.1209\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test, performed to evaluate differences in OB-GYN access across abortion policy levels, yielded a p-value of 0.1209, indicating that the observed differences in median OB-GYN ratios across the groups are not statistically significant at the commonly used 0.05 threshold.\nHowever, despite the lack of statistical significance, an ANOVA permutation test is conducted to further explore potential relationships. This is motivated by the patterns observed in the visualizations, which suggest a noticeable gradient in OB-GYN access that may merit further investigation.\n\n\nANOVA Permutation Test\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The means of OBGYN ratios are equal across all levels of abortion policy.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one group mean of OBGYN ratios is significantly different across the levels of abortion policy.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = obgyn_per_100k, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean OB-GYN Access per 100,000 Women\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean OB-GYN Access in 2023 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plot displays that states with “most protective” and “very protective” abortion policies exhibit relatively high OB-GYN access, with mean values close to or above 15 OB-GYNs per 100,000 women. As abortion policies become more restrictive, a gradual decline in OB-GYN access is evident, with states categorized as “very restrictive” and “most restrictive” showing the lowest mean access levels, averaging closer to 10 or fewer OB-GYNs per 100,000 women. This gradient suggests that restrictive abortion policies may correlate with reduced access to OB-GYNs, reflecting broader healthcare limitations in these states. However, the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated no statistically significant differences, so this pattern should be interpreted cautiously and corroborated with further analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# First, calculate the observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Perform permutation test\nset.seed(1234) # For reproducibility\nN &lt;- 100000 # Number of permutations\nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$obgyn_per_100k &lt;- sample(permuted_data$obgyn_per_100k) # Fixed assignment\n  \n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate the p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\n# Print results\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 1.958188 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.09937 \n\n\nCode\nhist(perm_F, \n     main = \"Distribution of F-statistics under Null Hypothesis\",\n     xlab = \"F-statistic\",\n     col = \"palegreen4\", \n     breaks = 50)\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test for the association between OB-GYN access and abortion policy levels yielded an observed F-statistic of 1.958188 and a p-value of 0.09937 which suggests that the differences observed in the mean OB-GYN access across abortion policy levels are not statistically significant at a conventional threshold (e.g., 0.05). Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the variation in OB-GYN access across these policy levels may be due to random chance.\nDespite the lack of statistical significance, the visualization below provides valuable insight into the distribution of OB-GYN access by abortion policy levels. It shows that states with more protective abortion policies generally have a higher proportion of observations with above-average OB-GYN access, whereas more restrictive states are more likely to fall below average. While these patterns are not confirmed by the statistical test, they may still point to meaningful differences in healthcare infrastructure that merit further investigation.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Calculate the overall average\noverall_avg &lt;- mean(df$obgyn_per_100k, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Filter and classify observations as Above or Below Average\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(abortion_policies) & !is.na(obgyn_per_100k)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(above_or_below = if_else(obgyn_per_100k &gt; overall_avg, \n                                  \"Above Average\", \"Below Average\"))\n\n# Group and count observations\ndf_count &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies, above_or_below) %&gt;%\n  summarize(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Convert counts to percentages\ndf_count &lt;- df_count %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart\nggplot(df_count, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percentage, fill = above_or_below)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Above Average\" = \"#1c7416\", \"Below Average\" = \"#ff0000\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"Percentage of Observations\",\n       fill = \"Comparison to Average\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Above/Below Average OBGYN Ratio by Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications\nDespite the lack of statistical significance in the association between OB-GYN access and abortion policy levels, this analysis was worth exploring due to the visible patterns in the data.These patterns raise important questions about the alignment of restrictive abortion policies with broader commitments to women’s healthcare access.Further research could help explore and clarify this relationship, potentially identifying ways to address healthcare gaps and improve outcomes for underserved and vulnerable populations."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThe overall health analysis demonstrates that abortion policy levels are strongly associated with broader public health indicators, including overall health rankings, healthcare quality, access, and affordability. States with protective abortion policies consistently perform better across these measures, suggesting a commitment to fostering equitable healthcare systems that prioritize both reproductive rights and general healthcare access. These states likely integrate reproductive healthcare into broader public health initiatives, addressing root causes of poor health and promoting preventative care.In contrast, restrictive abortion policies are frequently associated with poorer health outcomes, lower healthcare quality, and reduced access to essential services. These patterns suggest that states with restrictive polcies may not only limit reproductive autonomy but also systemically under investm in public health infrastructure which can exacerbate existing inequities, leaving vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, without adequate healthcare resources.\nAlthough some relationships, such as OB-GYN access by abortion policy, did not achieve statistical significance, visible trends warrant further investigation. Future research could explore these patterns with more granular data or alternative methodologies to better understand the systemic implications of abortion policy restrictiveness on healthcare equity."

This includes increased pressure on already strained healthcare systems, reduced funding for maternal health programs, and a potential deterrent effect on providers offering comprehensive reproductive care. Together, these factors could worsen disparities, leaving more women unable to access the care they need during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum, particularly in underserved communities which reinforces the interconnectedness of abortion policy, maternal health, and systemic inequities in healthcare access."

This suggests that restrictive abortion policies may correlate with a lack of access to insurance coverage during pregnancy, potentially exacerbating barriers to prenatal care.\nTo explore this observed association further, a Kruskal-Wallis test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.576, df = 6, p-value = 0.03475\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a p-value of 0.03475, providing significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This indicates that the median percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy differs among at least one of the abortion policy level groups. Interestingly, for the “most restrictive” policy level, the median and range drop significantly compared to the “very restrictive” group. This deviation could reflect unique policy or demographic factors in those states. However, the broader trend suggests that more restrictive abortion policies may align with higher uninsured rates during pregnancy.\nTo further validate the significance of these findings, we will now perform an ANOVA permutation test.\n\n\nANOVA Permutation Test\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is the same across all abortion policy groups.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): The mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is different in at least one of the abortion policy groups.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.4)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Women Uninsured During Pregnancy\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Women Uninsured During Pregnancy in 2021 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows that states with more protective abortion policies have the lowest mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy, as abortion policies become more restrictive, the mean percentage of uninsured women generally increases, peaking at the “very restrictive” level before dropping at the “most restrictive” level.\nTo strengthen the evidence for statistical significance,an ANOVA Permutation Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 4.561629 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0252 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yields a p-value of 0.0252, providing statistically significant evidence to support differences in the percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy across at least one abortion policy level. This p-value strengthens the findings from the Kruskal-Wallis test, further validating the existence of disparities linked to abortion policy restrictiveness.\n\n\nImplications\nRestrictive abortion policies correlate with higher uninsured rates among pregnant women, exposing disparities in healthcare systems that already struggle to provide adequate maternal care. THis ultimately suggests that further tightening will worsen gaps in coverage and maternal health outcomes, especially in states with limited resources. Increasingly restrictive policies may contribute to increased maternal mortality and morbidity by limiting access to affordable prenatal care, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment. Additionally, healthcare providers may be less inclined to practice in these states, further reducing access to quality care. Over time, these conditions could place growing financial strain on households and healthcare systems, deepening existing inequities."

The observed F-statistic lies far in the tail of the permutation distribution, reinforcing the conclusion that the observed differences in mean teen birth rates among the policy groups are unlikely to have occurred by chance. This supports the notion of a strong association between state abortion policy levels and variations in teen birth rates.\n\n\nImplications\nThese findings highlight that more restrictive abortion policies correlate with higher teen birth rates, potentially forcing adolescents into parenthood without adequate support, imposing long-term financial and emotional burdens on young families, as well as strain on healthcare and social services. While we have not examined related factors like comprehensive sex education, these results raise questions about whether states with more restrictive abortion policies also fail to invest enough in preventive measures and support systems, prompting a need for more research and evidence-based policy interventions."

    "text": "Conclusion\nEvidently, maternal health outcomes differ by abortion policy level, where protective policies often align with lower maternal mortality rates, fewer uninsured pregnant women, and lower teen birth rates. This suggests that states with supportive abortion policies coincide with better access to essential healthcare services and resources for women. By contrast, restrictive policies correlate with higher maternal mortality and teen birth rates, plus more uninsured pregnant women. This association implies that states limiting abortion access may also limit other forms of care, leaving women without adequate prenatal and postnatal support. In practice, this can force both adolescents and adults into parenthood under challenging conditions, with potential long-term social and economic consequences.\nThese patterns underscore that abortion policies are not isolated decisions. They reflect and influence broader healthcare availability, education, and economic stability for women. In the post-Dobbs environment, with abortion restrictions likely to increase, policymakers and stakeholders should consider how these measures fit into a wider effort to improve maternal health. Evidence-based policies that promote accessible care, comprehensive sex education, and supportive economic measures can help mitigate the negative maternal health outcomes associated with restrictive abortion laws"

    "text": "Unfortunately, it is difficult find reliable and accessible data on complications and unsafe abortions. Several factors may contribute to this lack of information. Initially, data was sought for miscarriage rates variation by state, how unsafe abortion rates evolved over time, illegal abortion rates, and data on women whose lives were endangered by the inability to access safe abortion services. However, these datasets either do not exist or are difficult to locate.\nMany elements might be responsible for this dearth of information. It may, for instance, be difficult or unrealistic to report on all miscarriages. Furthermore, there are stringent regulations surrounding all research done on pregnant women for obvious reasons. Data on unsafe or illegal abortions might not exists because these procedures may go unreported. However, the absence of these data sets is telling in and of itself, and is an issue for women’s health and public health on the whole regardless of political perspective or affiliation."

    "text": "Context & Case Studies\n\nSince the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, numerous stories have emerged illustrating the devastating impact of abortion bans on women and children’s health. For example, a study by Stevenson (2021) projected a 7% increase in maternal mortality in the first year following widespread abortion bans, with the rate rising to 23% in the subsequent year (Stevenson 2021). These findings highlight the immediate and severe health risks associated with restrictive abortion policies. Notably, vulnerable populations, including racial minorities and those with low socioeconomic status, are disproportionately affected.\nThe effects of the Dobbs decision have also had less direct negative impacts on women. Adkins et. al found an 11% increase in children placed in the foster care system in states that instituted TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws (Adkins et al. 2024). Wallace et. al. find a 3.4% increase in the likelihood that women fall victim to domestic partner violence with each additional implementation of a TRAP law (Wallace et al. 2024). These findings illustrate how abortion policy has ripple associations beyond immediate impacts on women’s health.\nWhile maternal mortality is one critical measure, it is only one piece of the larger picture. Well-being encompasses a wide range of factors, including access to prenatal care, economic stability, and the mental health of mothers and families. These indicators often vary widely across states, driven by differences in healthcare infrastructure, economic resources, and social support."

The slope coefficients and corresponding visualization indicate that the likelihood of having a mandatory parental leave policy (y=1) increases as abortion policies become more protective. This means that states with abortion policies that are more protective of reproductive rights are significantly more likely to mandate parental leave compared to states with restrictive abortion policies. These findings are significant as they underscore a critical contradiction: states that impose restrictive abortion policies, effectively limiting access to abortion and forcing women to carry pregnancies to term, are often the same states that fail to provide supportive measures, such as mandatory parental leave. This creates an environment that not only restricts reproductive autonomy but also neglects the financial stability and overall well-being of mothers, highlighting the systemic challenges faced by women in states with restrictive abortion rights, emphasizing the disparity in care and support provided to mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): There is no association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is an association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\n\n\nCode\n# Reorder the levels of abortion policies\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(parental_leave_job_protection), fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parental Leave Job Protection Policy\", \n       y = \"Proportion\", \n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Job Protection Requirements by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"No Job Protection\", \"1\" = \"Job Protection\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar plot suggests that states that provide job protection for parental leave are predominantly associated with protective abortion policies, while states without job protection are more likely to have restrictive abortion policies. This visualization accentuates a potential correlation, suggesting that states fostering better protections for parental leave are also those that support more protective abortion policies.\nTo explore this relationship further, Fisher’s Exact Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Fisher's exact test\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$parental_leave_job_protection, df$abortion_policies)\nfisher_test_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.006869\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nFisher’s Exact Test yields a p-value of 0.006869, providing sufficient evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between state abortion policy levels and the presence of job protection for parental leave. This result indicates that abortion policy restrictiveness or protectiveness is strongly related to whether states have policies safeguarding job security for individuals taking parental leave.\nBefore performing logistic regression, it is necessary to confirm that the data meets the required assumptions:\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): Abortion policy levels have no effect on the probability of job protection for parental leave.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level significantly affects the probability of job protection for parental leave.\n\n\nCode\n# Tabulate categories to see if sample sizes are sufficient\ntable(df$parental_leave_job_protection, df$abortion_policies)\n\n\n   \n    most protective very protective protective some restrictions/protections\n  0               1               4          6                             3\n  1               1               3          4                             2\n   \n    restrictive very restrictive most restrictive\n  0           7                4               16\n  1           0                0                0\n\n\nThe sample sizes are too small for standard logistic regression, particularly for categories like “restrictive”, very restrictive”, and “most restrictive,” which lack representation in one of the outcome groups.

These findings suggests that states with more protective abortion policies are more likely to have legislation guaranteeing job protection for parents taking parental leave to care for their children.\nCoefficients and visualization support this finding, showing a positive association between protective abortion policies and the likelihood of job protection policies. Alternatively, states with restrictive abortion policies often lack similar protections. These results emphasize another systemic contradiction: states that limit abortion access and force women to carry pregnancies to term often fail to establish policies that support parents, such as guaranteeing job protection during parental leave. This lack of support exacerbates the financial and social challenges for parents, notably women, creating an environment where having children is marked by financial insecurity and career uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The medians of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy levels.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level is associated with a significantly different median percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Employed\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Employed by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plots illustrates that states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have a higher median percentage of women employed compared to states with more restrictive policies. Further, there is greater variability in the employment percentages in states with restrictive policies, and notable outliers are present in several categories.\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_women_working by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.889, df = 6, p-value = 0.0309\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a significant p-value of 0.0309, allowing us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the median percentage of women employed across at least one level of abortion policy. However, examining the above box plot visualization, it is evident that the relationship is not straightforward. For example, states with “very protective” abortion policies exhibit a surprisingly low median employment percentage—the second lowest across all groups, after states with the most restrictive policies. This deviation highlights an outlier among the protective policy groups and suggests that other factors beyond abortion policy restrictiveness may be influencing female employment rates in these states. This observation warrants further investigation into state-specific socioeconomic conditions or other contextual variables that could explain these discrepancies.\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The means of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy categories.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy category is associated with a significantly different mean percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean % Women Working\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Working by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plots suggests a modest pattern: states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have somewhat higher mean percentages of working women, while those with increasingly restrictive policies show slightly lower averages. However, these differences appear small, indicating that if there is a trend, it may not be pronounced or other factors could be influencing women’s employment levels.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation test\nn_perm &lt;- 10000 \n\n# observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\nset.seed(6547) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(n_perm)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_perm) {\n  # permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_women_working &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_women_working)\n  \n  # ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 2.588987 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0296 \n\n\nCode\n# visualization\nhist(perm_F, breaks = 30, main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", xlab = \"F-statistic\", col = \"#acdf87\")\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test for the ANOVA further confirms a significant p-value (p = 0.0296), providing evidence that the mean percentage of employed women in at least one abortion policy category differs from the others. However, as observed in the visualizations, this does not necessarily indicate a straightforward or “linear” relationship between more protective abortion policies and higher female employment rates.\n\n\n\nThe results from the Economic Wellness hypothesis testing indicate that abortion policies often reflect broader policy environments influencing women’s economic stability. States with restrictive abortion policies not only limit reproductive autonomy but have also failed to foster preexisting conditions that support women’s workforce participation and financial independence, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable women. Therefore, it’s essential for policymakers to address these intersecting challenges by advocating for comprehensive workplace protections, such as mandatory parental leave, job security policies, equitable access to affordable childcare, and other measures that enable women to achieve economic independence, regardless of their reproductive choices."

The slope coefficients and corresponding visualization indicate that the likelihood of having a mandatory parental leave policy (y=1) increases as abortion policies become more protective. This means that states with abortion policies that are more protective of reproductive rights are significantly more likely to mandate parental leave compared to states with restrictive abortion policies. These findings are significant as they underscore a critical contradiction: states that impose restrictive abortion policies, effectively limiting access to abortion and forcing women to carry pregnancies to term, are often the same states that fail to provide supportive measures, such as mandatory parental leave. This creates an environment that not only restricts reproductive autonomy but also neglects the financial stability and overall well-being of mothers, highlighting the systemic challenges faced by women in states with restrictive abortion rights, emphasizing the disparity in care and support provided to mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): There is no association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is an association between abortion policy levels and the presence of parental leave job protection.\n\n\nCode\n# Reorder the levels of abortion policies\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(parental_leave_job_protection), fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parental Leave Job Protection Policy\", \n       y = \"Proportion\", \n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Job Protection Requirements by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"No Job Protection\", \"1\" = \"Job Protection\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar plot suggests that states that provide job protection for parental leave are predominantly associated with protective abortion policies, while states without job protection are more likely to have restrictive abortion policies. This visualization accentuates a potential correlation, suggesting that states fostering better protections for parental leave are also those that support more protective abortion policies.\nTo explore this relationship further, Fisher’s Exact Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Fisher's exact test\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$parental_leave_job_protection, df$abortion_policies)\nfisher_test_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.006869\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nFisher’s Exact Test yields a p-value of 0.006869, providing sufficient evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between state abortion policy levels and the presence of job protection for parental leave.

These findings suggests that states with more protective abortion policies are more likely to have legislation guaranteeing job protection for parents taking parental leave to care for their children.\nCoefficients and visualization support this finding, showing a positive association between protective abortion policies and the likelihood of job protection policies. Alternatively, states with restrictive abortion policies often lack similar protections. These results emphasize another systemic contradiction: states that limit abortion access and force women to carry pregnancies to term often fail to establish policies that support parents, such as guaranteeing job protection during parental leave. This lack of support exacerbates the financial and social challenges for parents, notably women, creating an environment where having children is marked by financial insecurity and career uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The medians of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy levels.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy level is associated with a significantly different median percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Employed\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Employed by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plots illustrates that states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have a higher median percentage of women employed compared to states with more restrictive policies. Further, there is greater variability in the employment percentages in states with restrictive policies, and notable outliers are present in several categories.\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, a Kruskal-Wallis Test is performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_women_working by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.889, df = 6, p-value = 0.0309\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a significant p-value of 0.0309, allowing us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the median percentage of women employed across at least one level of abortion policy. However, examining the above box plot visualization, it is evident that the relationship is not straightforward. For example, states with “very protective” abortion policies exhibit a surprisingly low median employment percentage—the second lowest across all groups, after states with the most restrictive policies. This deviation highlights an outlier among the protective policy groups and suggests that other factors beyond abortion policy restrictiveness may be influencing female employment rates in these states. This observation warrants further investigation into state-specific socioeconomic conditions or other contextual variables that could explain these discrepancies.\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The means of women’s employment percentages are the same across all abortion policy categories.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy category is associated with a significantly different mean percentage of women’s employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean % Women Working\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Working by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plots suggests a modest pattern: states with the most protective abortion policies tend to have somewhat higher mean percentages of working women, while those with increasingly restrictive policies show slightly lower averages. However, these differences appear small, indicating that if there is a trend, it may not be pronounced or other factors could be influencing women’s employment levels.\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation test\nn_perm &lt;- 10000 \n\n# observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\nset.seed(6547) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(n_perm)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_perm) {\n  # permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_women_working &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_women_working)\n  \n  # ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 2.588987 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0296 \n\n\nCode\n# visualization\nhist(perm_F, breaks = 30, main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", xlab = \"F-statistic\", col = \"#acdf87\")\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test for the ANOVA further confirms a significant p-value (p = 0.0296), providing evidence that the mean percentage of employed women in at least one abortion policy category differs from the others. However, as observed in the visualizations, this does not necessarily indicate a straightforward or “linear” relationship between more protective abortion policies and higher female employment rates.\n\n\n\nThe results from the Economic Wellness hypothesis testing indicate that abortion policies often reflect broader policy environments influencing women’s economic stability. States with restrictive abortion policies not only limit reproductive autonomy but have also failed to foster preexisting conditions that support women’s workforce participation and financial independence, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable women. Therefore, it’s essential for policymakers to address these intersecting challenges by advocating for comprehensive workplace protections, such as mandatory parental leave, job security policies, equitable access to affordable childcare, and other measures that enable women to achieve economic independence, regardless of their reproductive choices."

States with more protective abortion policies are consistently associated with higher levels of education among women, suggesting that these states may prioritize investments in policies and resources that support both reproductive autonomy and access to education. In contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies are linked to lower levels of educational attainment, potentially reflecting systemic under investment in women’s educational opportunities and broader socioeconomic support. This connection underscores the dual challenge faced by women in states with restrictive abortion policies: not only are their reproductive rights diminished, but these states also fail to create conditions that enable women to pursue and attain higher education. Such disparities highlight the need for comprehensive policy reform that addresses both reproductive rights and access to education, ensuring that women in all states, regardless of abortion policy, have equal opportunities to achieve higher educational attainment."

The visualization of the permutation distribution supports this conclusion, as the observed F-statistic lies well beyond the bulk of the null distribution, indicating a meaningful difference among the policy categories.\n\n\n\nWomen Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence by Abortion Policy\n\nKruskal-Wallis Test\nNull Hypothesis (Ho): The medians of the percentage of women experiencing intimate partner violence are the same across all abortion policy categories.\nAlternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one abortion policy category is associated with a significantly different median percentage of women experiencing intimate partner violence.\n\n\nCode\n# Box plot visualization\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Experiencing Domestic Violence\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence in 2021 by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021 by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 10.88, df = 6, p-value = 0.09215\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test resulted in a p-value of 0.09215, which does not provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests no statistically significant relationship between the prevalence of intimate partner violence among women and the strictness of a state’s abortion policy.\nFurther, the box plot visualization supports this finding, showing variability within and across the abortion policy levels. While the mean percentages, displayed below, indicate slightly higher rates of intimate partner violence in states with more restrictive abortion policies, this pattern is not statistically significant based on the Kruskal-Wallis test results.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"%\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence in 2021 by State Abortion Policy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications\nThe Mental Wellness analysis revealed that only one measure, postpartum depression screening, showed a statistically significant association with abortion policy categories. States with more protective abortion policies had higher screening rates, reflecting a broader commitment to maternal mental health care in these states. Other indicators, such as postpartum depression rates, depression before or during pregnancy, and intimate partner violence, did not show statistically significant differences across abortion policy categories. While trends in the visualizations suggest potential patterns, these outcomes highlight the influence of other factors, such as socioeconomic conditions and access to healthcare. These findings underscore the need for further research to explore the relationship between states’ abortion policy levels, maternal mental health, and systemic support."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Maternal Wellness analysis highlights how abortion policies serve as proxies for broader systemic conditions that impact women’s wellness across economic, educational, and mental health measures, emphasizing the interconnected nature of reproductive rights and systemic support for women. States with protective abortion policies are consistently associated with better outcomes—such as higher levels of educational attainment, greater economic stability through parental leave and job protection policies, and higher postpartum depression screening rates. Conversely, restrictive abortion policies are not only linked to environments that fail to support women’s autonomy, workforce participation, and access to essential health resources but also expose a key contradiction: these policies force women to carry pregnancies to term while neglecting to provide maternal wellness support, such as job protections, affordable childcare, or mental health care. This juxtaposition underscores a systemic failure to prioritize the long-term well-being of mothers and families.\nAddressing these disparities requires comprehensive policy reforms that extend beyond reproductive autonomy to include equitable access to education, employment opportunities, and mental health resources. This holistic approach is vital to improving outcomes for women, particularly in states where restrictive abortion policies coincide with limited systemic support. Following the Dobbs decision, as restrictions on abortion are likely to increase, these reforms will become even more critical to counteract the growing disparities and ensure women’s wellness is holistically supported across the United States."
